# Arteludovica

This project is living here ===> [arteludovica.com.ar](https://www.arteludovica.com.ar/)

On this site, all the material from the Arteludovica Theater Company is available. There are galleries of images, videos and PDF downloads. There are also three sections or subsites corresponding to each of the theater productions premiered by the company. In each case, the design of the section varies to adapt to the aesthetics of the respective play.

This is the second site I developed with HTML, CSS, and Javascript on the frontend, along with a simple backend developed with PHP and a SQL database. Then I rebuild the site with Next.js, Typescript and SASS.
